The project aims to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of graph learning methods for analyzing expansive and interconnected cryptoasset transaction graphs. This initiative is set against a backdrop of challenges in cryptoasset analytics, including the reliance on limited ground-truth data and the growing complexity due to the interconnected nature of various crypto-ecosystems across different ledgers and layers. The anticipated outcomes include the development of a comprehensive cryptoasset knowledge graph, a systematic evaluation of graph learning techniques, and the introduction of an innovative multi-layer conceptualization for cryptoasset transactions. This project addresses the urgent need for advanced analytical tools in the face of increasingly intricate and evolving digital finance environments.
